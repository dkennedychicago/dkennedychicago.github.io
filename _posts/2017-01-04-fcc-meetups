##FCC Meetups
So I have begun organizing meetup for the local chapter of Free Code Camp Chicago. The facebook for Chicago has 2000 members but when I joined there was only one regular meeting and since then it has stopped. There does seem to be a lot of interest but of course the issue is that people have busy lives and timeing and location don't work for everyone.
It would be cool if there was a facilitator that could hold meeting in different neighborhoods on different days of the week.
